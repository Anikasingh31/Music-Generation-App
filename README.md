Music Generation App

Overview

The Music Generation App utilizes a Genetic Algorithm to create unique musical sequences based on user feedback. The system evolves melodies over multiple generations, optimizing them using a fitness function that rates melodies based on user input. The generated melodies can be saved as MIDI files and played back using a synthesizer.
